# Data Analytics with Cognos - Group 3(Covid-19 Case Analysis)

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has had a profound and far-reaching impact on the world since its emergence in late 2019. Understanding and analyzing COVID-19 cases is essential for both public health authorities and researchers to monitor the spread of the virus, assess its impact on communities, and develop effective strategies to mitigate its effects.COVID-19 case analysis involves examining various aspects of the pandemic, such as the number of confirmed cases, testing rates, demographics of those affected, geographic spread, severity of illness, healthcare system capacity, and vaccination rates. This data analysis is crucial for identifying trends, making informed decisions, and planning responses to control the virus. In this context, we will explore different dimensions of COVID-19 case analysis, including the epidemiological, social, and economic factors, as well as the public health interventions and policies implemented to combat the pandemic. This analysis will provide insights into how the pandemic has evolved, its impact on healthcare systems, and the challenges and lessons learned throughout its course.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of robust data collection and analysis in guiding public health responses, vaccine distribution, and containment strategies. By examining COVID-19 cases in detail, we can better understand the dynamics of the virus and work towards minimizing its impact on society.
